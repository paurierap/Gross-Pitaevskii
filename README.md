# Gross-Pitaevskii 

GPE solver. To run, create a spatial mesh using ```Generate_Mesh1D.jl```, which also provides a time discretization from ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\(0,T\]). Then run ```main.jl```, which solves the GPE with $![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\beta=-2)$.
